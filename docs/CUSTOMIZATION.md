## Study Prompt (`study_prompt.txt`)

The AI's personality, output structure, and generation rules are defined in `config/study_prompt.txt`. You can modify this file to:

- Change the tone of the generated textbook chapter.
- Add or remove sections from the study material.
- Update the "Bloom's Taxonomy" based question requirements.
- Change the formatting or language requirements.

The script expects a `{transcript}` placeholder at the end of the file where the source text will be injected.
